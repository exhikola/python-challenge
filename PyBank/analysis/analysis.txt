-Import the csv module to handle CSV file operations.

Initialize variables to store the necessary data:
total_months: Keeps track of the total number of months.
total: Accumulates the total profit or loss.
profit_changes: Stores the changes in profit month by month.
greatest_increase: A list to store the date and amount of the greatest increase in profits.
greatest_decrease: A list to store the date and amount of the greatest decrease in profits.
Open and read the "budget_data.csv" file using a with block. The csv.reader is used to read the data from the file.
Skip the header row using header = next(csvreader) to move to the actual data.

Iterate through the rows in the CSV file using a for loop:

Extract the date and profit/loss values from the first and second columns, respectively.
Increment total_months to keep track of the total number of months.
Add the profit/loss value to the total to calculate the net total profit or loss.
Calculate the profit change for the current month and append it to the profit_changes list.
Check if the current month has a greater increase or decrease in profits and update the greatest_increase and greatest_decrease variables accordingly.
Update previous_profit_loss to store the profit/loss for the next iteration.
After processing all the data, calculate the average profit change and store it in the average_change variable.

Print the results of the financial analysis, including the total number of months, net total profit or loss, average change in profit, and the months with the greatest increase and decrease in profits.
